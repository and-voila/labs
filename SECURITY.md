# And Voila Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Our project is continuously evolving. There are no older versions. Each update, patch, and feature is applied to your current version of andvoila.ai.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Your safety and security are paramount. If you find a security vulnerability, **[contact us directly](mailto:hi@andvoila.ai)** instead of using the public issue tracker.

This approach allows us to fix the issue discreetly.

We value your help in keeping our community secure. Expect acknowledgment within 48 hours and a detailed response within a week, outlining our action plan.

We'll keep you informed about our progress in resolving the vulnerability and will make a public announcement. If you don't hear from us within 48 hours, please follow up.

Your discretion is appreciated. Thank you for helping keep And Voila secure.
